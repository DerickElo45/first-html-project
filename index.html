          Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of
          Mvezo, in the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918. His mother was Nonqaphi
          Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela,
          principal counsellor to the Acting King of the Thembu people,
          Jongintaba Dalindyebo. In 1930, when he was 12 years old, his father
          died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward of Jongintaba at the Great
          Place in Mqhekezweni1. Hearing the elders’ stories of his ancestors’
          valour during the wars of resistance, he dreamed also of making his
          own contribution to the freedom struggle of his people.

          He attended primary school in Qunu where his teacher, Miss Mdingane,
          gave him the name Nelson, in accordance with the custom of giving all
          schoolchildren “Christian” names. He completed his Junior Certificate
          at Clarkebury Boarding Institute and went on to Healdtown, a Wesleyan
          secondary school of some repute, where he matriculated. Mandela began
          his studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University College of
          Fort Hare but did not complete the degree there as he was expelled for
          joining in a student protest. On his return to the Great Place at
          Mqhekezweni the King was furious and said if he didn’t return to Fort
          Hare he would arrange wives for him and his cousin Justice. They ran
          away to Johannesburg instead, arriving there in 1941. There he worked
          as a mine security officer and after meeting Walter Sisulu, an estate
          agent, he was introduced to Lazer Sidelsky. He then did his articles
          through a firm of attorneys – Witkin, Eidelman and Sidelsky. He
          completed his BA through the University of South Africa and went back
          to Fort Hare for his graduation in 1943.

          Mandela, while increasingly politically involved from 1942, only
          joined the African National Congress in 1944 when he helped to form
          the ANC Youth League (ANCYL). In 1944 he married Walter Sisulu’s
          cousin, Evelyn Mase, a nurse. They had two sons, Madiba Thembekile
          "Thembi" and Makgatho, and two daughters both called Makaziwe, the
          first of whom died in infancy. He and his wife divorced in 1958.
          Mandela rose through the ranks of the ANCYL and through its efforts,
          the ANC adopted a more radical mass-based policy, the Programme of
          Action, in 1949. In 1952 he was chosen as the National
          Volunteer-in-Chief of the Defiance Campaign with Maulvi Cachalia as
          his deputy. This campaign of civil disobedience against six unjust
          laws was a joint programme between the ANC and the South African
          Indian Congress. He and 19 others were charged under the Suppression
          of Communism Act for their part in the campaign and sentenced to nine
          months of hard labour, suspended for two years. A two-year diploma in
          law on top of his BA allowed Mandela to practise law, and in August
          1952 he and Oliver Tambo established South Africa’s first black-owned
          law firm in the 1950s, Mandela & Tambo.2 At the end of 1952 he was
          banned for the first time. As a restricted person he was only
          permitted to watch in secret as the Freedom Charter was adopted in
          Kliptown on 26 June 1955.

    <h3>The Treason Trial</h3>
    <p>
      The Treason Trial Mandela was arrested in a countrywide police swoop on 5
      December 1956, which led to the 1956 Treason Trial. Men and women of all
      races found themselves in the dock in the marathon trial that only ended
      when the last 28 accused, including Mandela, were acquitted on 29 March
      1961. On 21 March 1960 police killed 69 unarmed people in a protest in
      Sharpeville against the pass laws. This led to the country’s first state
      of emergency and the banning of the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress
      (PAC) on 8 April. Mandela and his colleagues in the Treason Trial were
      among thousands detained during the state of emergency. During the trial
      Mandela married a social worker, Winnie Madikizela, on 14 June 1958. They
      had two daughters, Zenani and Zindziswa. The couple divorced in 1996. Days
      before the end of the Treason Trial, Mandela travelled to Pietermaritzburg
      to speak at the All-in Africa Conference, which resolved that he should
      write to Prime Minister Verwoerd requesting a national convention on a
      non-racial constitution, and to warn that should he not agree there would
      be a national strike against South Africa becoming a republic. After he
      and his colleagues were acquitted in the Treason Trial, Mandela went
      underground and began planning a national strike for 29, 30 and 31 March.
      In the face of massive mobilisation of state security the strike was
      called off early. In June 1961 he was asked to lead the armed struggle and
      helped to establish Umkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation), which launched
      on 16 December 1961 with a series of explosions.
